### About Me
*I graduated Saratov Railway Transport Technical College and work in my specialty for five years. But I don't want to go any further in this field. I want to change my profession and become a frontend developer.

*I think I can do it because I have traits such as:
- *Discipline*
- *Self-learning*
- *Work in a team*

### Skills:
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- Figma
- VS Code

### Code Example
This is my solution to the last Kata on **Codewars**:
```js
const findAverage = (array) => {
  if (!array.length) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    const sumOfNumbers = array.reduce((accumulator, number) => {
      return accumulator + number;
    }, 0);
    return sumOfNumbers / array.length;
  }
}
```
